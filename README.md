# TypeScript Features

This repository demonstrates various features of TypeScript through concise examples and explanations. The aim is to help developers understand and utilize TypeScript's powerful features for writing robust and maintainable code.

## Features Covered

The repository includes examples and explanations of the following TypeScript features:

### 1. Basic Type Annotations
- Usage of `string`, `number`, `boolean`, and other basic types.
- Type inference and explicit type annotations.

### 2. Interfaces and Types
- Defining and extending interfaces.
- Using type aliases.
- Differences between `interface` and `type`.

### 3. Classes and Object-Oriented Programming
- Class declarations and inheritance.
- Access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`).
- Abstract classes and interfaces.

### 4. Generics
- Creating generic functions and classes.
- Using constraints in generics.

### 5. Advanced Types
- Union and intersection types.
- Literal types and type narrowing.
- Discriminated unions.

### 6. Utility Types
- Using built-in utility types like `Partial`, `Pick`, `Omit`, and `Record`.

### 7. Decorators
- Overview of class, method, and property decorators.

### 8. Modules and Namespaces
- Importing and exporting modules.
- Namespaces for organizing code.

### 9. Type Assertion and Type Guards
- Using `as` for type assertions.
- Custom type guards for runtime type checks.

### 10. Enums
- Using numeric and string enums.
- Advantages and limitations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the examples, you need:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later).
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) installed globally.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/naijamesz/typescript-features.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd typescript-features
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running Examples
You can run individual TypeScript files to see the examples in action:
```bash
npx ts-node <path-to-example-file>
```

Alternatively, you can compile the TypeScript files to JavaScript and run them:
```bash
npx tsc
node <compiled-js-file>
```

Enjoy exploring TypeScript's features and happy coding!
